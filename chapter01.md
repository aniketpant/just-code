# Chapter 1: Why are you here?

Most people who are working in the web industry ended up here because they were passionate about it. It doesn't take courses or formal education to do well in this field. All you need to have is the will to put in hours of effort and the ability to think beyond what you can see.

## Coding is an art

For long, people have been relating coding with sciences, but I feel that it isn't right. Programming may require education but _anyone_ can learn to code. This is why I think of it as a skill and associate it with art.

Drawing an analogy on the same here, let's say we talk about dance. Anyone can dance well if they can put in the effort and dedication to learn it. They might not become an exceptional dancer but they can definitely pick it up and do well. That's the same case with coding.

## Why code?

It's simple enough for me.

> To make the world a better place.

I believe in the above statement because the web definitely has the power to change the way things happen and it diminishes the boundaries of physical interaction, allowing a faster exchange of ideas. Creating and solving problems is human nature, and there are plenty of examples to justify the statement.

If you still wonder why you should code, then I assume that Facebook, Twitter, Google or for that matter any web based service haven't been a part of your life.

## Where do I start?

This is the first question that comes to anyone's mind when they think about coding. To be frank it is one of the most important phases because the first step sets the tone for your following years. If you look at the web, you will see that each website has a few things to offer. When you look closer you will find that you can work in any of the components that form a website.

From experience I have seen that many beginners get down to creating their websites in their first few days. This might come across as a great thing to many people but I think that they should first take a look at all their options and then get dirty with one.

Learning to create websites is not a very difficult thing and nowadays you will come across over thousands of blogs and screencasts on the same. I still remember the time when I saw Chris Coyier's screencast - PDF to HTML.

## Your background doesn't count and will never count

The following statements might not be relevant to your country or region, but in India there's a prevalent mindset that degrees prove your worth in the society.

While we talk about web development specifically, one doesn't need a degree to do well. As I said before, it is a skill and can be easily learnt by anyone. Though, there are few things that are expected from anyone who wishes to excel and these expectations exist for any skill.

## If you are scared of working hard, then turn away

Mind you, if hard work is not your cup of tea then you might want to think of some other fields to work in. People practice for hours to become good at something. This also doesn't mean that you should work 20 hours a day to better yourself. Always remember -

> Rome wasn't built in a day.

Take small steps and remain determined.

> I was talking to a friend one day who happens to be a User Interface Designer. On a totally unrelated note, his background is fine arts. We were discussing about sketching and he started showing me different strokes and how one could easily make all of them. I had learnt to sketch many years ago but I could never sketch strokes like him. The only answer he gave me was "Keep practising".

This simple statement has been told to us over and over, in many different ways. "Practice makes a man perfect" is one of the most commonly used phrase and it is true. The more you practice, the better you will become. It is obvious that you will fall at times and you might even get stuck with some problems you won't be able to solve. In these times, the community will be there to support you. Yes, we are going to be there for you.
