# Chapter 1: Why are you here?

Most people who are working in the web industry ended up here because they were passionate about it. It doesn't take courses or formal education to do well in this field. All you need to have is the will to put in hours of effort and the ability to think beyond what you can see.

## Coding is an art

For long, people have been relating coding with sciences, but I feel that it isn't right. Programming may require education but _anyone_ can learn to code. This is why I think of it as a skill and associate it with art.

Drawing an analogy on the same here, let's say we talk about dance. Anyone can dance well if they can put in the effort and dedication to learn it. They might not become an exceptional dancer but they can definitely pick it up and do well. That's the same case with coding.

## Why code?

It's simple enough for me.

> To make the world a better place.

I believe in the above statement because the web definitely has the power to change the way things happen and it diminished the boundaries of physical interaction, allowing a faster exchange of ideas. Creating and solving problems is human nature, and there are plenty of examples to justify the statement.

If you still wonder why you should code, then I assume that Facebook, Twitter, Google or for that matter any web based service haven't been a part of your life.

## Where do I start?

This is the first question that comes to anyone's mind when they think about coding. To be frank it is one of the most important phases because the first step sets the tone for your following years. If you happen to look the web, you will see that each website you see has a few things to offer you. When you look closer you will find that you can work in any of the components that form a website.

From experience I have seen that many beginners get down to creating their websites in their first few days. This might come across as a great thing to many people but I think that they should first take a look at all their options and then get dirty with one.

Learning to create websites is not a very difficult thing and in the present scenario you will come across over thousands of blogs and screencasts on the same. I still remember the time when I saw Chris Coyier's screencast- PDF to HTML.
