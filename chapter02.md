# Chapter 02: Motivation

One of the few things anyone struggle with is motivation. It is the key ingredient in doing well and you really can't start unless you are really want to.

## I don't know how to code

Before this question even comes to your mind, you need to know about [Jennifer Dewalt](http://jenniferdewalt.com/). If you are absolutely clueless about coding and are not sure where to start with, the first thing you need to do is make her your role model.

She started with the basic idea of learning to code and then she made a small plan to make it happen. Her target was to build a website a day for 180 days. She hasn't stopped a day and hasn't lost track of her objective. Read [her post](http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/56319597560/im-learning-to-code-by-building-180-websites-in-180) on the same.

## Do I have it in me?

Another question which perturbs many beginners. Make a plan and dive into it. It's pointless speculating if you have it in you or not. How can you even ask that question when you haven't tried?

> _I can't_ is a phrase used by people before they even try.

Give coding a shot. You may have it in you!

## Dive into it

Don't waste time in deciding and looking for what to do. Just go for it.

You can start with a small project like _A Website A Week_ which will most definitely help in honing your skills. I have seen so many people work on projects like these. [Luke Beard](http://lukebeard.com), a designer worked on a personal project called _A Lyric A Day_ in which he would take up a line from a song and then try to create a design around it. It was a pleasure to see his work everyday and even if you look at it now, you'll love it.
