# Chapter 3: Starting to code

This should be easy. There are many things you can start with and it's important to experiment with your options.

If you are planning to go into web development, in that case you need to learn two sets of languages.

1. Front-end languages:
	These would include **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.
2. Back-end languages:
	**PHP**, **Python** and **Ruby** are the popular scripting languages. For interacting with databases, you will need either **SQL** or **NoSQL**.

## Take your pick and get started

We will discuss the implication of each of these languages later. For now, you should experiment with each of them.

In a lay man's definition: Writing HTML is like building a house. CSS is designing your house. And JavaScript is interacting with your house. Similarly, the scripting languages allow you to connect rooms. The database is analogous to a storage.

Let's say you are learning a foreign language, it's a very common process to learn it via examples and using the language on an everyday process. The same principle can be applied here.

Learning each of these languages individually is cumbersome and it's a longer process. Moreover, someday you will have to use them together.

## Start with a page

You can't build your house in one go. You always start with a room. Similarly, here also you will begin with a page and then slowly build your website.

Write HTML to create the walls and then use CSS to paint them. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It forms the building blocks of your page. Similarly, use CSS to style your page the way you want it.

Making random pages is boring and tedious. Instead, why not create your personal website. It can have an opening page with a bad-ass picture of yourself and a little write-up. You can then make a small contact page with your email id and a contact form which can be powered by a small PHP script.

There are many tutorials available on the same, you can even follow a few screencasts to get a hang of it.
