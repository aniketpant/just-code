# Foreword

I am glad that you are reading this handbook. It means a lot to me and I thank you for it.

The basic intention of writing a small handbook came from a number of people who used to come to me with questions like -

- Where do we start?
- What should I learn?
- How much time should I put in?
- What all can I do after learning to create web pages?
